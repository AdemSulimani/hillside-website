        <h2>3. Sources of Data</h2>
        <p>We collect personal data from the following sources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Directly from you:</strong> through account registration,
            onboarding, product configuration, support requests, and in-platform
            settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>From Meta Platforms:</strong> through the Facebook Graph API,
            Instagram Graph API, and WhatsApp Business Cloud API, via webhooks and
            API calls initiated when your connected channels receive or send
            customer messages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>From your use of the platform:</strong> through your
            interactions with platform features, dashboards, and settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>From your customers:</strong> customer data is provided during
            conversations and order workflows within your connected channels, and
            is processed on your behalf as the business customer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you disconnect a Meta channel or third-party integration from the
          platform, we will cease ongoing collection of data from that source.
          Data previously collected will be retained and processed in accordance
          with this Privacy Policy and applicable legal obligations, unless you
          request deletion as described in Section 12.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Meta Platform Data: Processing Principles</h2>
        <p>
          This section sets out Hillside&apos;s specific obligations and commitments
          with respect to data obtained from Meta&apos;s platforms through API
          access (&quot;Meta Platform Data&quot;), in accordance with Meta Platform
          Terms and Developer Policies.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 Processor Role</h3>
        <p>
          Hillside processes Meta Platform Data solely as a data processor on
          behalf of, and under the instructions of, our business customers.
          Hillside does not independently determine the purposes or means of
          processing Meta Platform Data beyond what is necessary to deliver the
          services requested by the business customer.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Permitted Use</h3>
        <p>Meta Platform Data is processed exclusively to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            deliver inbound and outbound messaging functionality through your
            connected Meta channels;
          </li>
          <li>
            generate AI-assisted responses and support sales automation workflows
            authorized by you;
          </li>
          <li>provide customer support and inbox management features; and</li>
          <li>
            enable analytics, quality monitoring, and service improvement features
            within the scope of your configured account.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Prohibited Uses of Meta Platform Data</h3>
        <p>Hillside expressly does not, and will not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            sell, license, or transfer Meta Platform Data to any third party for
            their independent use;
          </li>
          <li>
            use Meta Platform Data for advertising, retargeting, or marketing
            purposes unrelated to the specific business interaction through which
            the data was collected;
          </li>
          <li>
            create or contribute to independent user profiles by combining Meta
            Platform Data with data from other businesses or external sources;
          </li>
          <li>
            aggregate Meta Platform Data across multiple business customers for
            purposes of cross-business analytics, profiling, or data monetization;
          </li>
          <li>
            use Meta Platform Data for credit scoring, fraud scoring unrelated to
            platform security, surveillance, or law enforcement purposes (except
            where required by law); or
          </li>
          <li>
            use Meta Platform Data in any manner inconsistent with the specific
            permissions granted by the end user or business customer.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.4 Messaging Initiation</h3>
        <p>
          All automated or AI-assisted messaging through Meta channels is
          initiated, configured, or explicitly authorized by the business customer.
          The platform does not autonomously initiate outbound communications with
          end users outside of the workflows, message templates, and configurations
          established by the business customer. Business customers are responsible
          for ensuring that all automated communications comply with applicable Meta
          messaging policies, including opt-in requirements and permitted message
          windows.
        </p>

        <h3>4.5 Data Segregation</h3>
        <p>
          Meta Platform Data is processed on a per-business-customer basis. Data
          from one business customer&apos;s connected channels is not shared with,
          aggregated with, or used to benefit any other business customer. Each
          authorized Meta channel integration is processed independently within the
          scope of the specific permissions granted by the business customer.
        </p>

        <h3>4.6 AI Processing of Meta Platform Data</h3>
        <p>
          Message content and related metadata obtained through Meta channels may
          be processed by AI providers acting as Hillside&apos;s authorized
          subprocessors. Such processing is limited to generating AI-assisted
          replies, detecting purchase intent, supporting order workflows, and
          conducting quality checks—all on behalf of the relevant business customer.
          AI providers are bound by written agreements that restrict their use of
          the data to providing services on Hillside&apos;s behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hillside does not use Meta Platform Data to train general-purpose or
          unrelated machine learning models; Meta Platform Data is processed only to
          provide the platform services described in this Policy and for
          improvements permitted under Meta Platform Terms and our agreements with
          subprocessors.

        <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Authentication Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We use HTTP-only session cookies to manage authentication and maintain
          your login state. These cookies are strictly necessary for platform
          security and are not used for advertising or behavioral tracking.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Browser Storage</h3>
        <p>
          Certain platform features may store session tokens or operational data
          in browser local storage to enable specific application functionality.
          This is limited to operational use within the platform.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 No Third-Party Advertising Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We do not use third-party advertising cookies, behavioral tracking
          pixels, or cross-site tracking technologies in the platform as currently
          operated. If this changes, we will update this Privacy Policy, provide
          appropriate notice, and implement required consent mechanisms.

        <h2>7. Disclosure of Data</h2>
        <p>We do not sell personal data. We disclose personal data only in the following circumstances:</p>

        <h3>7.1 Service Providers (Subprocessors)</h3>
        <p>
          We share data with authorized subprocessors who process data on our behalf
          to operate and support the platform. All subprocessors are bound by
          written agreements that restrict their use of data to providing services
          on our behalf, impose data protection obligations, and prohibit use for
          any independent purpose. See Section 9 for a list of key subprocessors.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2 Meta APIs</h3>
        <p>
          When you send replies or interact with customers through connected Meta
          channels, message content is transmitted via Meta&apos;s APIs as part of
          the platform&apos;s core functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>7.3 Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose personal data when required by applicable law, valid

          successor entity, subject to appropriate confidentiality and data
          protection obligations.

        <h2>8. AI Processing and Model Improvement</h2>
        <p>
          AI-generated outputs are produced using AI infrastructure provided by our
          authorized subprocessors (including OpenAI, L.L.C.). When you or your
